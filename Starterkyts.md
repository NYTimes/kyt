## How to build a starter-kyt
starter-kyts act as boilerplates for projects. They use kyt as their build system and add new tools.

1. Choose your starter-kyt architecture. Make sure you are familiar with the [kyt conventions](/conventions.md).

2. Add additional dependencies to a package.json

3. Set up `/src/server/index.js` and `/src/client/index.js` files

4. Optionally add `.stylelintrc` and `.eslintrc` configurations to be copied into the user directory

4. Create documentation

5. Submit to [kyt](/issues) to be considered as a recommended starter-kyt
