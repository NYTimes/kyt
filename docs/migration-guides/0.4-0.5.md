# Migration Guide 0.4 - 0.5

## Upgrade dependencies
- If using `babel-preset-kyt-react` upgrade to 2.2.

## New Linter rules
We've upgraded both ESLint and stylelint which includes some new changes to lint rules. If these new lint rules don't work for your project you can override them in your `.eslintrc.json` and `stylelint.rc`.

Take a look at our current list of lint rules
- [eslint](/packages/eslint-config-kyt)
- [stylelint](/packages/stylelint-config-kyt)

## Webpack 2.2 final
We've upgraded to the final Webpack 2.2

If you're using `System.import` you can now use `import`
```js
  import('./myFile')
  .then(module => cb(null, module.default));
```
You can read more about it in the [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-import/#dynamic-import)
**Note:** You'll have to upgrade `babel-preset-kyt-react` if you're using it in order to use the `import`

If you are currently searching for any loaders in `modifyWebpackConfig()`, note that they have been renamed to include "loader"
eg. css --> css-loader, style --> style-loader

## Jest 19
We've upgraded from Jest 16 to Jest 19.

New features include:
- New expects support (expect.any, expect.anything, expect.objectContaining, expect.arrayContaining, expect.stringMatching)
- Versioning for snapshots: this is a breaking change so you'll have to update your snapshots. To do so, run `npm test -- -- -u`
-  [jest.spyOn](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/jest-object.html#jestspyonobject-methodname)

You can read about all the changes in their [Changelog](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
