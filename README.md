# kyt

Every sizable JavaScript web app needs a common foundation: a setup to build, run, test and lint your code. kyt is a toolkit that encapsulates and manages the configuration for web apps.

Read more about kyt in our [blog post](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/introducing-kyt-our-web-app-configuration-toolkit/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NYTimes/kyt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NYTimes/kyt) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/NYTimes/kyt.svg)](https://david-dm.org/NYTimes/kyt) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/kyt.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kyt)

## Quick Start

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v6.0+ required).
2. `npm install -g kyt-cli`
3. `kyt-cli setup` - This will set up your project with application and configuration files so that you can get started with kyt. Learn more about [setup](/packages/kyt-cli/README.md).
4. `npm run dev`
5. Check out `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

* Optional universal support with a Node server provided for rendering front-end page requests
* Client and server hot reloading
* Custom Babel presets with ES6 support, optional React support and optimizations for polyfilling Node and browser builds.
* CSS Module and SASS support
* PostCSS support
* Static asset support
* Inline SVG support
* Style and script linter rulesets
* A pre-configured test runner with Jest
* Optional client-only mode for apps that already have a server

## How it Works

kyt manages configuration for all aspects of development. It can be installed as an npm dependency into a new or existing project. kytâ€™s goal is to encapsulate only development tools, giving users the freedom to control their source directory and make important decisions about app architecture. kyt provides a [command line interface](/docs/commands.md) for running all development tools.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/kyt-diagram.png"></p>

Developers design their own architecture, choosing the tools they need for rendering, styling, and handling data.

For advanced use cases, kyt enables developers to add additional tools and configuration.
See our [config override instructions](/docs/kytConfig.md#modifywebpackconfig) for details, and our [recipes](/docs/Recipes.md) for examples.

_In an attempt to gather feedback to set future priorities, we're running a brief user survey asking: [what are you using `modifyWebpackConfig` for?](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt/issues/432)_


## Setting up a kyt project

kyt-cli is a utility for bootstrapping kyt projects. It can be installed globally and run to create a new project or integrate kyt with an existing project.

`kyt-cli setup`

See the [kyt-cli](/packages/kyt-cli/README.md) documentation for more details.

## Command line

kyt includes a command line program with all the commands needed for development.

Running `kyt-cli setup` includes these commands as scripts in your package.json:

```
npm run dev
```

Or you can run a command using `node_modules/.bin/kyt command`:

```
node_modules/.bin/kyt build
```

Here are the available commands:

* [`dev`](/docs/commands.md#dev) starts a development environment
* [`build`](/docs/commands.md#build) compiles server and client code for production use
* [`test`](/docs/commands.md#test) runs all tests in /src
* [`proto`](/docs/commands.md#proto) starts the prototyping app
* [`lint`](/docs/commands.md#lint) lints src code using ESLint
* [`lint-style`](/docs/commands.md#lint-style) lints src code using Stylelint
* [`help`](/docs/commands.md#help) shows commands and their documentation

See our [CLI docs](/docs/commands.md) for further details.

## Conventions

kyt follows a few simple conventions.

All projects must have the following structure:
```
  src/
    client/
      index.js
    server/
      index.js
```

Each `index.js` file acts as the build entry.

*(Note that `server/index.js` is not required if `hasServer` is `false` in [config](#configuration)).*

If you're setting up a new project see our full list of [conventions](/docs/conventions.md).


## Configuration

kyt allows you to specify options in a `kyt.config.js` file.
See the [kyt config docs](/docs/kytConfig.md) for instructions.

kyt uses Webpack to compile src code and run tests.
See our [recipes](/docs/Recipes.md) for extending configuration.

To configure Babel, kyt respects `.babelrc` files defined at the root of user projects, and provides [presets](/packages/babel-preset-kyt-react) to provide opinionated configurations. (If no `.babelrc` is defined in the user project, [`babel-preset-kyt-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-kyt-core) is used.)

## starter-kyts

While kyt can be easily integrated into new or existing Node projects, it is even more powerful when used with a starter-kyt. A starter-kyt offers the benefits of boilerplates while minimizing the amount of new tools to learn and maintain. The `kyt-cli setup` command installs any preconfigured starter-kyt git repository, adding additional dependencies and building a source directory.

See our recommended list of [starter-kyts](/packages/kyt-cli/README.md).

### How to build a starter-kyt

Community supported starter-kyts can be built to support a variety of projects.
See additional info on [how to build a starter-kyt](/docs/Starterkyts.md).
