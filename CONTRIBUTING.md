# How to contribute to kyt

There are two ways to contribute to kyt:

## Contribute to open issues

We're looking for developers to help maintain kyt. 
See something you think we should address? Open an issue.
   
   
### kyt local development
We recommend forking kyt and linking it to a test repo for easy development. 

Note: React hot loader and the test command currently do not work with a linked kyt dependency.

## Build a starter-kyt

Have a great idea for a boilerplate? Build it on top of kyt and let us know about it. 
We feature [recommended starter-kyts](/Starterkyts.md)
