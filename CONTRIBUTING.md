# How to contribute to kyt

There are two ways to contribute to kyt:

## Contribute to open issues

   We're looking for developers to help maintain kyt. 
   See something you think we should address? Open an issue.

## Build a starter kyt

  Have a great idea for a boilerplate? Build it on top of kyt and let us know about it. 
  We feature [recommended starter-kyts](/Starterkyts.md)
