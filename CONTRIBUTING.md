# How to Contribute to kyt

## Contribute to open issues

We're looking for developers to help maintain kyt.
See something you think we should address? Open an issue.

### Submitting a PR

Please make sure all PRs are:

1. linted (npm run lint)
2. tested (npm test)
3. Connected to an issue
4. Update the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) (for MASTER) to reflect your PR changes.

### Create an RFC

If you want to propose a large feature idea or architecture change you should consider submitting an RFC. It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept in an issue before starting the RFC. RFCs are an evolving process in the kyt repository so expect a lot of changes and guidelines in the future. You can find the kyt RFC template [here](/rfc/template.md).

## kyt local development

We recommend installing `npm` version 5.3.0 or later: `npm i npm -g`

1. Fork and clone kyt
2. Run `npm run bootstrap` to install the packages in the monorepo.

[lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is used to manage the monorepo but most of the development commands should be exercised through root directory package.json scripts. The following are some useful npm scripts for development:

### bootstrap

`bootstrap` will install `node_modules` (hoisting most dependencies to the root `node_modules` directory) across all of the packages and symlink local package dependencies. Starter kyt sources (`starter-src/`) are fully installed (not hoisted) and `kyt` is linked.

From the root of kyt, run:

`npm run bootstrap`

### clean-bootstrap

`clean-bootstrap` is useful after you make or pull down kyt with dependency changes. It will remove `node_modules` directories before calling `bootstrap`.

From the root of kyt, run:

`npm run clean-bootstrap`

### Test

Unit tests for all packages in the monorepo can be run from the root of the repository: `npm run test`.

Similarly, e2e tests, located in the `e2e` directory can be run from the root of the repository: `npm run e2e`

### Lint

The monorepo has a top level `lint` command which runs lint for all the packages: `npm run lint`

### Testing local kyt-core changes

It is a common workflow to make changes to kyt-core and test them with `kyt-cli setup`. To get around installing the latest kyt-core, there's an option in setup to specify which version of kyt you want to reference. For instance, by executing the following locally, you can setup a directory called test and install your local version of kyt-core:

`kyt-cli setup -d test -k file:../kyt/packages/kyt-core`

### Testing local starter-kyt changes

To test setting up/installing local starter-kyts, you need to specify the `--local-path` option. This allows you to install a starter-kyt locally by copying rather than cloning from git.


`kyt-cli setup -d test  --local-path /path/to/my-local-starter-kyt-dir`

## Build a starter-kyt

Have a great idea for a boilerplate? Build it on top of kyt and let us know about it. Directions are [here](/docs/Starterkyts.md).
We feature [recommended starter-kyts](/docs/commands.md#recommended-starter-kyts)
